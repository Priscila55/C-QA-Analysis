# C-QA-Analysis
Quality Assurance data analysis system in C. Processes and reports production line issues with optimized algorithms

The project implements various algorithms for processing production log data, including:
- Merge Sort: Used to sort log entries by date
- Linked List: Converts log entries into a linked list for efficient data storage and retrieval.
- Binary Search: Finds the earlier occurence of a product issue
- Linear Search: Searches for specific log, entries based on given criteria.

Features: 
- Sorts log data efficiently using merge sort
- Stores and processes data using a linked list
- Allows binary search for quick lookup of production issues
- Implements linear search for sequential data retrieval
